xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

Objective

Using xv6 as a starting point for kernel development, I will be working
through various external OS material, to review OS theory in depth, while
implementing core OS abstractions (e.g. threading/virtual memory/file system
etc.) on top of xv6. Some of the resources I have studied include

[Operating Systems: 3 Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
[xv6 manual](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6/book-rev8.pdf)
[OS Dev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)
[Broken Thorn OS Dev Series](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html)
